# Ghub Pegasus WMS Tutorial and Templates

The [Pegasus Workflow Management System (WMS)](https://pegasus.isi.edu) comprises software that automates and manages the execution of computational workflow jobs, including staging the jobs, distributing the work, submitting the jobs for execution, as well as handling data flow dependencies and overcoming job failures.

This Jupyter Notebook tool provides a tutorial and templates for running Pegasus workflows on Ghub.

This tool provides Pegasus pipeline workflow templates which associates two simple workflow jobs to create a "Hello World" demonstration of Pegasus using an abstract YAML file and a cluster submission. This tool provides templates for workflow jobs written in the `Bash`, `CCP`, `Fortran`, `MATLAB`, `Python` and `R` programming languages. The `Bash` template is selected by default.

These workflow jobs are executed on the University at Buffalo (UB)'s [Center for Computational Research (CCR)](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html)'s generally accessible high performance compute cluster, UB-HPC, using Pegasus and submit!

This tool is published on the [Ghub Science Gateway](https://theghub.org), see [Pegasus Workflow Tutorial and Templates](https://theghub.org/tools/ghubex1) to launch this tool on Ghub, you must be logged in as a Ghub member to launch this tool.
