# Ghub Pegasus WMS Tutorial and Templates

This Jupyter Notebook tool provides an introductory tutorial and templates for running Pegasus WMS workflows on Ghub.

The [Pegasus Workflow Management System (WMS)](https://pegasus.isi.edu) comprises software that automates and manages the execution of computational workflow jobs, including staging the jobs, distributing the work, submitting the jobs for execution, as well as handling data flow dependencies and overcoming job failures. These workflow jobs are executed on the University at Buffalo (UB)'s [Center for Computational Research (CCR)](https://www.buffalo.edu/ccr.html) High Performance Compute Cluster, UB-HPC, using Pegasus and submit!

This tool provides templates for workflow jobs written in the `Bash`, `C`, `CPP`, `Fortran`, `MATLAB`, `Python` and `R` programming languages.

This tool is published on the [Ghub Science Gateway](https://theghub.org), see [Pegasus WMS Workflows Tutorial and Templates](https://theghub.org/tools/ghubex1) to launch this tool on Ghub; you must be logged in as a Ghub member to launch this tool.
